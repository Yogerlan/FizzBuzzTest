# Fizz-Buzz test validation
Six test cases are employed for validation.

0. No input parameters. The result is the same of the original problem statement.
1. Output range between 0 and 10.
2. For multiples of two print "Fizz", for multiples of seven print "Buzz".
3. Output range between 1 and 1000.
4. Output range between -10 and 10 in reverse.
5. For multiples of -4 print "Fizz", for multiples of 8 print "Buzz". Output range between -1000 and 1000.

You should first move inside the **validate** folder, then execute the **test.py** script for each solution.

```bash
./test.py cpp
./test.py python
