# Fizz-Buzz test
The **Fizz-Buzz test** is an interview question designed to help filter out the 99.5% of programming job candidates who can't seem to program their way out of a wet paper bag. The text of the programming assignment is as follows:

>Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print *"Fizz"* instead of the number and for the multiples of five print *"Buzz"*. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print *"FizzBuzz"*.
